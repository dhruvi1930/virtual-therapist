People today are struggling to express their emotions. The result is that the person feels hurt and angry. In order to improve mood, we need a mood enhancer. I created software that uses CNN to detect the user's current emotion and make sympathetic suggestions depending on that feeling, whether it be through speech or a facial image.

I have used [Fer2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deadskull7/fer2013) dataset image to text and [RAVDESS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio) dataset speech to text from Kaggle.
